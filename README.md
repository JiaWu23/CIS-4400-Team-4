# Business Requirement: 


Business problem: A growing number of people are moving to new places, making it difficult and time-consuming to locate trustworthy healthcare professionals in an unknown place. People look for the best doctors by reading reviews and ratings and taking their preferred location into account. Users cannot readily compare providers based on location and specialty thanks to the fragmented and non-standardized nature of the current healthcare data. 

Our proposal is to create a complete data solution that categorizes doctor ratings according to geography (state, city, county) and specialization. This will enable users to locate the finest healthcare providers in their new area through an interactive platform that allows them to evaluate and review doctors.

Benefits: The purpose of this project is to create a better accessible and structured healthcare information system, which will benefit all users and providers involved. The tension and effort involved in locating high-quality healthcare in new locations will be reduced because of the centralized data warehouse, which will enable people to decide regarding healthcare providers based on ratings, geography, and specialization. Additionally, the site will improve users' entire healthcare experience by assisting them find highly-rated experts.


Cost:  The project's anticipated cost includes a number of essential factors, for example- staff, development, data gathering, and maintenance. Collecting data details and getting thorough ratings information on healthcare could include paying license fees to data suppliers. The platform's user interface and backend infrastructure for data processing and storage will be built, and these expenses will be covered by development funds. Pay for data engineers, software developers, project managers, and quality assurance teams will be included in personnel costs. The project is expected to take 12 months to complete, with phases for data collecting, development, testing, and deployment. After launch, further upkeep and assistance will be needed to guarantee platform operation and data accuracy.

Risks: One of the project's risks is the possibility of bias in the ratings, since user reviews might not always reflect an unbiased evaluation of a healthcare provider's performance. Individual expectations and personal experiences can have a significant impact on ratings and make it difficult to accurately represent a doctor's overall quality of care. To counter this, the platform will use algorithms to identify and flag anomalies in the reviews, like extreme ratings or irregular feedback patterns. Moreover, by offering users in-depth analyses of ratings across different dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, bedside manner), users will have a more nuanced perspective, which will help to lessen the impact of biased ratings.

# Data Architecture

Overview: Define the overall structure and design of the data within the project, including how data is collected, processed, stored, and retrieved.
 
Structure:
Define data integration points, especially if data comes from multiple sources.
Ensure the architecture supports data consistency, integrity, and scalability.
Deliverables:
Data Architecture Diagram showcasing data flow and storage mechanisms.
Detailed Description of Data Architecture, explaining data sources, data processing workflows, and data storage solutions.

Overview: Our data architecture is driven by external sources, RateMDs and Healthgrade. From these sources, we can use the bottom-up approach to structure the data architecture for this project. The diagram represents the structure of how the data is collected, processed, stored, and retrieved.
